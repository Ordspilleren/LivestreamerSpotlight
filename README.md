# LivestreamerSpotlight

LivestreamerSpotlight is a way to quickly open your favorite streams in media players like VLC and MPC-HC.

## Dependencies

* .NET Framework 4.5
* A video player capable of playing HLS streams (in the case of Twitch.tv at least)

## Installation

Simply grab the latest release from the Releases section here on GitHub (or compile it yourself), and put in a folder somewhere safe.

## Usage

Simply open the application, set up the path for a video player of your choice, and you are done.

If you want a keyboard shortcut for opening the application, either create a shortcut and bind that to a hotkey, or pin the application to your taskbar and press WINKEY + n'th place on taskbar (in my case, i pinned it as the 3rd item on my taskbar, so I press WINKEY + 3)

## Issues

Probably a lot at this point. Here are some of the major ones:

* Not a lot of error handling, so if it crashes, too bad.

## To-Do

* Stream chat
* More services
* Autocomplete based on previous inputs
* Settings window of some kind
